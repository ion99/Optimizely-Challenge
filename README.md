# Optimizely-Challenge

The project is a simple page. It has an exit intent modal that pops up when desktop visitors attempt to leave the page. The library used for this is Ouibounce:

The modal itself will need to dynamically display the visitorâ€™s city based on their IP address. The API to use for this is freegeoip:

It will also need to include a 1-hour countdown timer. The library to use for this is FlipClock.js:
